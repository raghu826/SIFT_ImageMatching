# SIFT_ImageMatching
#### Implemented  Image Matching using SIFT Feature Extraction technique

Image Matching is used to identify how similar the images. This can be done comparing the feature descriptors.
SIRF and SURF are the two main and patented feature extraction techniques. Python-contrib module gives access to both the functions.
After detecting the keypoints and the descriptors from the images, Brute force matcher is used to check the similarity.
Depends upon length of the variable `matches`, you can conclude whether the images are same or not.
